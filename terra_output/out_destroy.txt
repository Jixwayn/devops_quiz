PS D:\65315628\devops_quiz> terraform destroy

Changes to Outputs:
  - app_url = "http://localhost:3000" -> null

You can apply this plan to save these new output values to the Terraform state, without changing any real infrastructure.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes


Destroy complete! Resources: 0 destroyed.
